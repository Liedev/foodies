## What Is Foodies

A .net core mvvm code first project with fluent validation where an admin could add Meals and their recipes. A user could add these meals with their recipes to their selection and make a shopping list so they could follow the instructions in making the meal.  

## Project
This project was created for the sole purpose to connect healthy food with people. This idea came to me when the pounds started to add up when corona came into play. I'd love to make this project a reality someday.
